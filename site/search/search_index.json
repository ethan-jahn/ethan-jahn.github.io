He is interested in exploring across boundaries of discipline: how visual arts, science, music, and people can interact to create a conversation that probes new realms. This is his second time as an artist for AEOR. In February 2024, he presented on digital collage as an artform rooted in the surrealist and dadaist tradition that intersects seamlessly with modern practices of science communication. This year, he co-lead a workshop with Laura Cilios on music as a vehicle for embodied conversation, or how active listening and participation in collective audio improvisations can help build skills for contextualization and association-building in research methodologies and communication. The workshop culminated in a collaborative, improvised jam session inspired by topics discussed throughout other artist workshops. He is presenting a piece this exhibition called 'Macrostructures of the Microcosmos' which is both a science communication piece on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (a phenomenon in cosmology) and a poetic exploration of the connection between our inner and outer worlds in the form of a zine.</p>"},{"location":"cv/","title":"Curriculum Vitae","text":""},{"location":"cv/#ethan-jahn-phd","title":"Ethan Jahn, PhD","text":"<p>computational astrophysicist | educator | hpc facilitator | musician | artist</p>"},{"location":"cv/#education","title":"Education","text":"<p>PhD -- Physics and Astronomy -- University of California, Riverside -- 2021</p> <p>BS -- Physics -- Minors: Mathematics, Computer Science -- Indiana University of Pennsylvania -- 2016</p>"},{"location":"cv/#professional-experience","title":"Professional Experience","text":""},{"location":"cv/#computing-sciences-researcher-ii-university-of-arizona-2023-pres","title":"Computing Sciences Researcher II -- University of Arizona -- 2023 -
