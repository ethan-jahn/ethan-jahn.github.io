# High Performance Computing

My current role is to support researchers using the HPC system at UA. This involves numerous activities, including working with users 1:1 to resolve issues, compiling and testing code, working with PIs to set up computational research workflows, and more. 

A couple of projects I've played a significant role in are 

1. the revamp of our [documentation website](https://hpcdocs.hpc.arizona.edu), which included reorganizing and rewriting the website from scratch, and

2. the expansion and updating of our [training workshops](https://hpcdocs.hpc.arizona.edu/events/workshop_materials/)

Both of these projects pull from my experience as an educator and involve the practical application of pedagogical perspectives I've developed therein, as well as significant efforts in the organization and presentation of technical information to an audience with a highly variable level of experience in the topics.
