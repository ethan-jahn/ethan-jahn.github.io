# Teaching

## Adunct Work
I have periodically taught community college physics courses as an adjunct professor.

I will be teaching PHY 122 at Pima Community College in Spring 2025

I have previously taught:

- Calc-based electricity and magnetism at Riverside City College (in-person, 4 terms)
- Calc and Alg-based newtonian mechanics at Mt. San Jacinto College (in-person 2 terms and online 2 terms)
- Calc-based newtonian mechanics at Mt. San Antonio College (in-person, 1 term)
- Calc-based thermodynamics and modern physics at Crafton Hills College (in-person, 2 terms)

...all of which included labs. 

## Teaching Assistant

At UC Riverside, I was a TA for the physics department for the following courses:

- General Electives for non-STEM majors
	- PHYS 010: “How Things Work” (concepts of electricity and magnetism) (1 term) 
	- PHYS 018: “Energy and the Environment” (1 term)
- Laboratories
	- PHYS 002LA: Algebra-based mechanics for life-sciences majors (1 term)
- Introductory Calculus-Based Physics for STEM majors 
	- PHYS 040A: Mechanics (1 term)
	- PHYS 040C: Electricity & Magnetism (4 term)
- Upper-Division Courses for Advanced Physics Majors
	- PHYS 111: Astrophysics & Stellar Astronomy (1 term)
	- PHYS 142W/190: Individual Study & Scientific Writing (1 term)

## Other

I was funded for one semester at UC Riverside to write, film, and edit instructional videos for PHYS 040C: Electricity & Magnetism.
