# Bio

Hi, I'm Ethan. I'm originally from southeastern Pennsylvania, but I lived in Riverside, California from 2016-2023 and currently reside in Tucson, Arizona. I do a number of different things and this website is an attempt to collect and display them in a way that is both cohesive and appropriately disjointed. 

Thanks for dropping by!

**Work** 

I am currently working at the University of Arizona for the High Performance Computing system, where I assist researchers using the machine and develop training materials and documentation.

**Astro** 

I studied computational astrophysics and cosmology at UC Riverside, where I received my PhD in 2021. While I no longer actively conduct research, I am still very interested in the field and in particular science communication of ideas and concepts from astronomy and cosmology. I have given public-facing science talks and volunteered at star parties. I am currently interested in exploring these things in Tucson, so if you have any relevant info or want me to give a talk somewhere, please drop a line!

**Music** 

I play in several bands in Tucson, AZ, as well as create my own music. I'm primarly a guitarist, but I also play synthesizers, keyboards, drums, and sing, to varying degrees of refinement. I have also been recording, mixing, and producing music for many years. 

**Digital Art** 

I primarily work with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to process images and create digital collages. I also use python to generate images. I have used GIMP for over 10 years, but have become more intentional about my artistic practice in the last couple of years as I have witnessed digital art mature in many ways. One of my favorite blogs about digital art is from [Adrian Pocobelli](https://pocobelli.net/)

**This Website**

I used a combination of [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and html/css/javascript to make this website. Backgrounds from [Texture Town](https://textures.neocities.org/).
