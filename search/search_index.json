He is interested in exploring across boundaries of discipline: how visual arts, science, music, and people can interact to create a conversation that probes new realms. This is his second time as an artist for AEOR. In February 2024, he presented on digital collage as an artform rooted in the surrealist and dadaist tradition that intersects seamlessly with modern practices of science communication. This year, he co-lead a workshop with Laura Cecilio on music as a vehicle for embodied conversation, or how active listening and participation in collective audio improvisations can help build skills for contextualization and association-building in research methodologies and communication. The workshop culminated in a collaborative, improvised jam session inspired by topics discussed throughout other artist workshops. He is presenting a piece this exhibition called 'Macrostructures of the Microcosmos' which is both a science communication piece on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (a phenomenon in cosmology) and a poetic exploration of the connection between our inner and outer worlds in the form of a zine.</p> <p>Macrostructures of the Microcosmos Zine</p>"},{"location":"aeor/#spring-2024-uc-riverside","title":"Spring 2024, UC Riverside","text":"<p>Spring 2024 Exhibition Program</p> <p>I served as an artist mentor for this program, focusing on digital collage through found media.

I'm originally from southeastern Pennsylvania, but I lived in Riverside, California from 2016-2023 and currently reside in Tucson, Arizona. I do a number of different things and this website is an attempt to collect and display them in a way that is both cohesive and appropriately disjointed. </p> <p>Thanks for dropping by!</p> <p>Work </p> <p>I am currently working at the University of Arizona for the High Performance Computing system, where I assist researchers using the machine and develop training materials and documentation.</p> <p>Astro </p> <p>I studied computational astrophysics and cosmology at UC Riverside, where I received my PhD in 2021. While I no longer actively conduct research, I am still very interested in the field and in particular science communication of ideas and concepts from astronomy and cosmology. I have given public-facing science talks and volunteered at star parties. I am currently interested in exploring these things in Tucson, so if you have any relevant info or want me to give a talk somewhere, please drop a line!</p> <p>Music </p> <p>I play in several bands in Tucson, AZ, as well as create my own music. I'm primarly a guitarist, but I also play synthesizers, keyboards, drums, and sing, to varying degrees of refinement. I have also been recording, mixing, and producing music for many years. </p> <p>Digital Art </p> <p>I primarily work with GIMP to process images and create digital collages. I also use python to generate images. I have used GIMP for over 10 years, but have become more intentional about my artistic practice in the last couple of years as I have witnessed digital art mature in many ways. One of my favorite blogs about digital art is from Adrian Pocobelli</p> <p>This Website</p> <p>I used a combination of mkdocs material and html/css/javascript to make this website.
